        "### Moving from MLP to CNN\n",
        "Now that we have seen how our two-hidden layer MLP performs, let's see how we can move on to a convolutional neural network (CNN). The advantage of a CNN is that the we no longer have an all-to-all connectivity structure between layers, but rather take a look at local (2-D or even 3-D) neighborhoods. This spatial (or even temporal) filter is then convolved over the whole input (here an image) by \"sharing the weights\" to every position. The outcome is typically referred to as a feature map and in order to check for multiple features we apply a set of such filters in parallel.  We will see how these effects improve our accuracy in contrast to our MLP. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let us see how to build a CNN with 2 layers with a fully-connected classifier on top and included pooling layers after every convolution. These layers generally subsample the input and introduce translation invariance (to an extent). The network should again have rectified linear units for activation functions and end on a fully-connected linear layer to the amount of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Define two convolution layers \"nn.Conv2d\" with 5 x 5 filters. Good starting values for amount of filters/features can be 64 in the first and 128 in the second layer.\n",
        "    2. Convolutions should be followed by ReLU activations. You can apply the activations in the definition of the forward pass with the functional package and \"F.relu\"\n",
        "    3. Each conv + act block should be followed by a 2 x 2 max pooling \"nn.MaxPool2d\" with stride 2.\n",
        "    4. You will need to calculate the remaining spatial dimensionality to flatten the convolutional output to feed it to the last fully-connected layer. "
