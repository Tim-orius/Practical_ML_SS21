For example, in the ImageNet ILSVRC challenge with a classification problem containing 1000 classes, it is common to report the top-5 accuracy.

The advantage of a CNN is that the we no longer have an all-to-all connectivity structure between layers, but rather take a look at local (2-D or even 3-D) neighborhoods. This spatial (or even temporal) filter is then convolved over the whole input (here an image) by \"sharing the weights\" to every position. The outcome is typically referred to as a feature map and in order to check for multiple features we apply a set of such filters in parallel.  We will see how these effects improve our accuracy in contrast to our MLP. \n",
